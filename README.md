# Viral Support 2.0

  ## Description 
  
  Using React, Tailwind, and Netlify I have made a portfolio page about myself and my work. This site contains a blog page with my latest information and posts, an about page with a description of me and my goals and interests, and a project page with examples of some of my best work. On the project page there are links to the repository and a brief description of the project. Attached at the navbar are four links to my LinkedIn, Github, and facebook.
